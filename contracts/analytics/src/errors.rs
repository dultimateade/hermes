//! Error types for the Analytics contract.
//!
//! Every variant is assigned an explicit `u32` discriminant that forms part of
//! the contract's **client-facing API surface**. The codes are consumed by
//! off-chain analytics dashboards, indexers, and monitoring tooling that may
//! persist or branch on the raw numeric value.
//!
//! # Stability guarantee
//!
//! Once a code appears in a deployed version it **must not** be renumbered,
//! removed, or reused for a different meaning without an explicit versioning
//! decision and a corresponding migration note in the PR description.
//!
//! New variants must be appended with a fresh, previously-unused code.  The
//! stability snapshot in `tests/err_stab.rs` will fail to compile until the
//! addition is deliberately registered there.
